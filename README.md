Hello, everyone!

This time, I will share the results of my project in creating a database in MySQL Workbench. I understand that managing such large amounts of data can be challenging using conventional methods. So, in this project, I created a database to help the company keep track of its important data.

The steps I took in this project are as follows:
1. Analyzing data issues
2. Dividing data into categories
3. Creating a new database model
4. Adding the necessary tables
5. Creating an EER (Extended Entity-Relationship) Diagram
6. Database Testing
With the creation of this database, I learned how to address the data issues that existed previously. Some of the advantages of creating a database are:
• Data is easier to understand because it is categorized.
• Redundancy of data is eliminated, simplifying data collection.
• Collected data follows a consistent format.
• Inconsistent data input is avoided.
• Data can be easily integrated as needed.

For a more detailed explanation of creating the database, you can read it in the Medium post I've created:
